> ## Project Summary -
This project entailed utilizing advanced data analytics techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the restaurants and customer feedback on the popular online food delivery platform, Zomato.
The data procured included the restaurant's name, location, cuisines, average cost for two, ratings, and user reviews. Subsequently, I embarked on the task of data cleaning and preprocessing,
which involved the elimination of duplicate entries, addressing missing values, and transforming the data into a format amenable to analysis.
The next step in the project was the implementation of clustering on the restaurant data through the use of the k-means algorithm. The objective of the clustering was to group similar restaurants together and 
discern patterns within the data. The features employed for the clustering process included the restaurant's location, cuisines, and average cost for two. The number of clusters was determined by utilizing the
elbow method. I then proceeded to conduct sentiment analysis on the user reviews to gain a comprehensive understanding of the overall sentiment towards the restaurants. Certain libraries were utilized to 
classify the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. 
In conclusion, this project exemplifies the utility of clustering and sentiment analysis in gaining a more profound comprehension of restaurant data on Zomato. 
The insights procured from the analysis can be of immense benefit to both restaurants and customers in making informed decisions. Furthermore, the project can be extended to other cities or even countries 
to gain insight into the eating habits and preferences of individuals in different regions.

> ### Problem Statement -
The problem statement for this project is to analyze and understand the restaurant industry in India by utilizing data from the Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up, Zomato. 
The project aims to gain insights into the sentiments of customer reviews, cluster Zomato restaurants into different segments, and analyze the data to make useful conclusions in the form of visualizations. 
The data analyzed includes information on cuisine, cost, and customer reviews. The project aims to assist customers in finding the best restaurant in their locality and aid the company in identifying areas 
for growth and improvement in the industry. Additionally, the project aims to use the data for sentiment analysis and identifying critics in the industry through the metadata of reviewers.

 > ### 8.  Conclusion:-

Clustering and sentiment analysis were performed on a dataset of customer reviews for the food delivery service Zomato. The purpose of this analysis was to understand the customer's experience and gain 
insights about their feedback.
The clustering technique was applied to group customers based on their review text, and it was found that the customers were grouped into two clusters: positive and negative. This provided a general
understanding of customer satisfaction levels, with the positive cluster indicating the highest level of satisfaction and the negative cluster indicating the lowest level of satisfaction.
Sentiment analysis was then applied to classify the review text as positive or negative. This provided a more detailed understanding of customer feedback and helped to identify specific areas where the 
service could be improved.
Overall, this analysis provided valuable insights into the customer's experience with Zomato, and it could be used to guide future business decisions and improve the service. Additionally, by combining
clustering and sentiment analysis techniques, a more comprehensive understanding of customer feedback was achieved.

Other important discoveries during analysis are -

* AB's - Absolute Barbecues, shows maximum engagement and retention as it has a maximum number of ratings on average and Hotel Zara Hi-Fi shows the lowest engagement as has the lowest average rating.
* The price point for high-rated hotel AB's= Absolute Barbecues is 1500 and the price point for low-rated restaurant Hotel Zara Hi-Fi is 400.
* North Indian food followed by Chinese are best or demand food as sold by most of the restaurants.
* Great Buffets are the most frequently used tags and other tags like Great, best, north, and Hyderabad are also used in large quantities.
* Satwinder Singh is the most popular critic who has a maximum number of followers and on average he gives a 3.5 rating.
* restaurant Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli is the most expensive restaurant in the locality which has a price of 2800 per order and a 3.5 average rating. Hotels like Amul and Mohammedia Shawarma are
* least expensive with a price of 150 and has a 3.9 average rating.

Some recommendations based on the analysis â–¶
* Based on negative reviews like some focused on issues with delivery time or food quality, the company should prioritize addressing these issues to improve customer satisfaction.
* Based on the clustering or user interaction customers should be given recommendations.
* Also use the clustering results to target specific customer segments and tailor marketing and promotional efforts accordingly.
